# workdash
This repository contains all of the project files I created to create an interactive Shiny dashboard that provides real-time insight into my job search.

## Background
After a 29-year career at Prudential, my position, along with those of 1,500 colleagues, has been impacted by leadership efforts to be more competitive. 
Proud of our collective contributions, I'm now eager to leverage my skills and retirement industry experience in new opportunities. Iâ€™m grateful for a fulfilling career at Prudential, I look forward to the next phase of my professional journey.

I love to work at the intersection of people, process, data and technology, and so I've been using my time to build my data analysis skills.  This effort is an opportunity for me to take on a passion project that, hopefully, will enable me to improve and refine my job search strategies over time.

## Outputs
My main output is to create an interactive Shiny dashboard I can share publicly.  As I plan and get underway, I will share additional updates.

## Analysis Challenges & Solutions
Here are the challenges I needed to overcome to complete this work and a summary of how I addressed each.

| Challenge                   | Problem    | Resolution |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Available Data           | The only data I have for this project is what I can collect. | I'm in the process of creating a data model for what I need, and will explore options from there.  I expect I'm need to collect some data, and perhaps some may be available via LinkedIn or other API. |

## Notes
This project is a work-in-progress; I will do my best to push commits from my local repository to Github.
