## Context

### Why R?

I wanted to build a dashboard I could share publicly, and I also knew I wanted to experiment with a sankey chart.  

The Power BI desktop application includes a sankey visual, but I didn't have an easy way to publicly share a Power BI report.  And Tableau Public provides access to visuals, but doesn't include a sankey visual.  A sankey visual was included as part of a beta test and subsequently removed.  

So I opted for R because I can push an interactive Shiny application to the RPubs site and share it publicly from there.  And the R networkD3 package provides functionality to build a sankey chart.



## Source Notes

[This article](https://r-graph-gallery.com/323-sankey-diagram-with-the-networkd3-library.html) by the team at the R Graph Gallery website served as a starting point for learning how to a sankey chart with R.
